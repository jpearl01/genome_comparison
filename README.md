# My First Attempt at a Rails Genome Comparison App

The object of this app is to be able to store genomes in a web-based database, which will track versions, edits, and general analyses which are standard here at [*The Center for Genomic Sciences*] http://www.centerforgenomicsciences.org

This is obviously a work in progress, and also my first "real" rails web-app, so I expect a fair amount of refactoring/code change will be going on during this process.
